% The text should be an extended abstract. It will be used as a handout during the

%
% If you want you may use \section to make sections in the abstract. But try to avoid

%
% If you wish to use references please do not use \cite and automatic reference
% creation. Instead write directly [1] to the text and create The references by hand.
% Please include references only if they are really important. Do not copy all
% references from an article you are talking about. Note that you do not have to write
% any references to your abstract at all if do not want to.
%
% If you are unsure how the extended abstract should look you may find some
% inspiration in "sbornicek" from recent years, e.g.
% http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~kamserie/serie/clanky/2006/s773.pdf After reading your
% extended abstract one should understand what is your talk about and have some idea
% what is going on. It is not expected that all proofs will be present.

\section{Introduction}

The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.
A~new approach to computer Go introduces:
\begin{description}
  \item [value networks] to evaluate board positions
  \item [policy networks] to select moves.
\end{description}
These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play.
Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play.

Furthermore, a~new search algorithm is introduced: it combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.
Using this search algorithm, the program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8 \% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5~games to 0.
This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.

TODO Soon aftewards, there was a~match between the World champion...

% Some text about the paper. 
% quaeram te, domine, invocans te, et invocem te credens in te: praedicatus enim es nobis.
% invocat te, domine, fides mea, quam dedisti mihi, quam inspirasti mihi per humanitatem 
% filii tui, per ministerium praedicatoris tui.
% 
% Second paragraph. Hope you like it.
% 
% \section{More formally}
% 
% \begin{definition}
% Magnus es, domine, et laudabilis valde: magna virtus tua, et sapientiae tuae non est numerus. 
% et laudare te vult homo, aliqua portio creaturae tuae, et homo circumferens mortalitem suam.
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{lemma}
% Sed quis te invocat nesciens te? aliud enim pro alio potest invocare nesciens. 
% an potius invocaris, ut sciaris? quomodo autem invocabunt, in quem non crediderunt.
% \end{lemma}
% 
% \begin{theorem}
% The very nice result.

% \begin{proof}
% A sketch of proof if You like. Maybe [1] is used here.

% \begin{corollary}
% Some more talking about the article.

% And even more talking about the article.

% Maybe this holds.
